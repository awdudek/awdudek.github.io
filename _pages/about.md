I'm a mathematician that dabbles. I wrote my honours thesis in graph theory, my [PhD thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07251) in analytic number theory (gotta love those prime numbers) before working as an options trader at [Optiver](https://www.optiver.com/) for five years. I also managed to fit in a good deal of teaching amongst all of this.

These days I live in Mothar Mountain QLD with my wife and our at-most-three children. I work part-time and remotely in the Education team at Optiver Sydney whilst working on a bunch of mathsy things in my spare time. I'm kept busy by working on little problems in number theory and graph theory, writing for and managing the [MathsFeed blog](https://mathsfeed.blog) and chasing my three tiny children around the yard.
