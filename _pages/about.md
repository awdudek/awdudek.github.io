I'm a mathematician that dabbles. I wrote my honours thesis in graph theory, my [PhD thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07251) in analytic number theory (gotta love those prime numbers) before working as an options trader at [Optiver](https://www.optiver.com/) for five years. I also managed to fit in a good deal of teaching amongst all of this.

These days I live in Mothar Mountain QLD with my wife and our at-most-three children. I work part-time and remotely in the Education team at Optiver Sydney whilst working on a bunch of mathsy things in my spare time. I'm kept busy by working on little problems in number theory and graph theory, writing for and managing the [MathsFeed blog](https://mathsfeed.blog) and chasing my three tiny children around the yard.

My Research Interests
======

I enjoy working on problems in number theory and graph theory. 

My number theory research has focussed on furnishing explicit estimates in the theory of prime numbers. For example, it has been known since 1937 that there is a prime between $n^3$ and $(n+1)^3$ for all sufficiently large values of $n$ (this is a step towards [Legendre's Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_conjecture#:~:text=Legendre's%20conjecture%2C%20proposed%20by%20Adrien,neither%20been%20proved%20nor%20disproved.)). One result from my PhD thesis was to make this explicit by showing that there is a prime between $n^3$ and $(n+1)^3$ for all $n \geq \exp(\exp(33.3))$. 

Another interesting area of research to me surrounds the well-known Riemann Hypothesis and its consequences to the distribution of prime numbers. Some of my work revolves around assuming that the Riemann Hypothesis is true and then seeing what we can prove about the primes from this assumption. See [here](http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1793042115500426?src=recsys) and [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05403).

I also like additive problems such as weak versions of [Goldbach's Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture) that every even number greater than two can be written as the sum of two prime numbers. In my research, I have shown that every integer greater than two may be
